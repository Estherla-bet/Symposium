**Project Overview**

This project examines how chronic disease and socioeconomic status intersect to shape functional aging among older adults in rural South Africa.
Specifically, it evaluates whether diabetes is associated with functional limitation and whether this association differs across socioeconomic groups.
This work contributes to the growing literature on healthy aging in low-resource settings by emphasizing structural inequities in chronic disease outcomes.

**Background and Rationale**
As life expectancy increases globally, more individuals are living longer with chronic diseases. Healthy aging is not defined by survival alone, 
but by maintaining functional independence. In rural African settings, chronic disease burden is increasing, socioeconomic disadvantage remains persistent 
and health system resources are limited. Understanding how diabetes and socioeconomic status (SES) jointly influence functional limitation is 
essential for informing equitable aging interventions.

**Research Objectives**

1. To examine the association between diabetes and functional limitation among adults aged 40+.
2. To assess the association between socioeconomic status and functional aging.
3. To evaluate whether SES modifies the relationship between diabetes and functional limitation.

**Data Source**

Data were obtained from HAALSI (2018–2019 Wave) A population-based longitudinal study conducted in rural South Africa within the
Agincourt Health and Demographic Surveillance System.
Sample size for analysis: N = 3,276 older adults

**Key Variables**

*Outcome*: Functional limitation (ADL/IADL-based measure)
*Exposure*: Self-reported diabetes status and Socioeconomic status (wealth quintiles)
*Covariates*:
Age
Sex
BMI
Marital status
Smoking status
Alcohol consumption

**Statistical Analysis**

Descriptive statistics were used to estimate prevalence of diabetes and functional limitation.
Multivariable logistic regression estimated adjusted odds ratios (aOR) with 95% confidence intervals.
Effect modification by SES was assessed through interaction terms.
Fully adjusted models controlled for demographic and lifestyle covariates.

**Key Findings**

10.1% of participants had functional limitation.
17.7% reported diabetes.
Functional limitation decreased across wealthier neighborhoods while diabetes prevalence increased across wealth quintiles.
In fully adjusted models, diabetes was significantly associated with functional limitation (aOR = 2.04, 95% CI: 1.50–2.79) 
Indicates that individuals with diabetes had more than twice the odds of functional limitation compared to those without diabetes.

**Interpretation**

These findings suggest that diabetes substantially increases risk of functional decline.
Socioeconomic inequalities shape aging trajectories as such clinical management alone may be insufficient to ensure healthy aging.
Healthy aging in rural African settings requires integrated chronic disease and functional care and an equity-focused service delivery
with structural attention to socioeconomic disadvantage.

**Implications**

Policy and practice implications include:
1. Integrating functional assessment into routine diabetes care.
2. Targeting chronic disease management toward socioeconomically disadvantaged populations.
3. Designing aging policies that move beyond survival toward functional independence.

**Study Limitations**

Cross-sectional design limits causal inference.

Diabetes was self-reported.

Residual confounding may remain.

Longitudinal analyses are recommended for future work.
